# Our first session (iOS)

Here we're assuming a jailbroken device, with r2frida dependencies that you would have with Workstation.

We're going to launch an r2 session using the special `frida://` URI which is
handled by the `r2frida` `r2pm` package that comes installed.

```sh
Â± r2 frida://$(idevice_id -l)/Safari
 -- Disassemble?! No Disassemble Johnny No. 5!!!
 ```

We use the `idevice_id -l` command which is part of [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice/)

## Help

Getting help for r2frida can be done using the `\?` command. The `?` command
alone will get help for r2, which is the primary environment you start in.
All r2frida commands will use this `\` prefix.

```md
